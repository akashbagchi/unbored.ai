# akashbagchi/claude-builder-2025 - Architecture Overview

High-Level System Design:

The `claude-builder-2025` repository consists of two main components: `ghost-onboarder` and `ghost-onboarder-site`. The `ghost-onboarder` component is a Python package that serves as the backend for the system, while `ghost-onboarder-site` is a Docusaurus-based React application that acts as the frontend.

Tech Stack:

- Python: The backend is written in Python, which is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
- Docusaurus: The frontend is built using Docusaurus, a React-based static site generator designed for creating documentation websites.
- React: The frontend user interface is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: The frontend codebase is written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, improving code maintainability and catching errors during development.

Major Components and Responsibilities:

1. `ghost-onboarder`:
   - `cli`: This module contains the command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the system.
   - `claude_client.py`: Handles communication with the Claude AI model.
   - `github_client.py`: Manages interactions with the GitHub API for repository analysis.
   - `lambda_function.py`: Contains the AWS Lambda function code for serverless deployment.
   - `main.py`: The main entry point for the backend application.
   - `prompts.py`: Defines the prompts used for querying the Claude AI model.
   - `scanner.py`: Responsible for scanning and analyzing repository files.
   - `score_repo_files.py`: Scores and ranks repository files based on their relevance.

2. `ghost-onboarder-site`:
   - `blog`: Contains blog posts and related assets.
   - `docs`: Holds the documentation content for the project.
   - `src/components`: Includes reusable React components for the frontend.
   - `src/pages`: Contains the main pages of the website, including the graph visualization.
   - `static`: Stores static assets like images and icons.

Data Flow Between Components:

1. The `scanner.py` module scans the repository files and generates a JSON representation of the repository structure.
2. The `score_repo_files.py` module scores and ranks the repository files based on their relevance.
3. The `claude_client.py` module interacts with the Claude AI model to generate summaries and insights for the relevant repository files.
4. The `github_client.py` module retrieves additional information from the GitHub API, if required.
5. The processed data is then passed to the `ghost-onboarder-site` component, where it is rendered and visualized using React components.

External Dependencies:

- Claude AI Model: The system relies on the Claude AI model for generating summaries and insights about the repository files.
- GitHub API: The `github_client.py` module interacts with the GitHub API to fetch repository metadata and other relevant information.
- AWS Lambda (optional): The `lambda_function.py` module allows for serverless deployment of the backend using AWS Lambda functions.

This overview provides a high-level understanding of the system's design, tech stack, major components, data flow, and external dependencies. It should help a developer with 2 years of experience grasp the overall structure and functionality of the `claude-builder-2025` repository.
