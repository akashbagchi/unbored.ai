# ../ - Architecture Overview

High-Level System Design:

The project is a monorepo consisting of two main components: `ghost-onboarder` and `ghost-onboarder-site`. The `ghost-onboarder` component is a Python package that serves as the core functionality, while `ghost-onboarder-site` is a Docusaurus-based website that provides a user interface and visualization for the project.

Tech Stack:

- Python: The primary programming language used for the core functionality of the project.
- Docusaurus: A React-based static site generator used for building the project's website.
- GitHub API: The project interacts with the GitHub API to fetch repository data.
- Claude API: The project likely interacts with the Claude API for natural language processing tasks.

Major Components/Modules:

1. `cli`: This module contains the command-line interface for the project.
2. `claude_client.py`: This module likely handles the interaction with the Claude API.
3. `github_client.py`: This module handles the interaction with the GitHub API.
4. `scanner.py`: This module is responsible for scanning and analyzing repositories.
5. `score_repo_files.py`: This module likely scores or evaluates the files in a repository.
6. `ghost-onboarder-site`: This is the Docusaurus-based website component of the project.

Data Flow:

1. The user interacts with the command-line interface (`cli` module) to initiate the scanning process.
2. The `scanner.py` module fetches repository data from GitHub using the `github_client.py` module.
3. The `score_repo_files.py` module analyzes and scores the repository files.
4. The scored data is likely processed and sent to the Claude API via the `claude_client.py` module for natural language processing tasks.
5. The processed data is then rendered and visualized on the `ghost-onboarder-site` website.

External Dependencies:

- GitHub API: The project relies on the GitHub API to fetch repository data.
- Claude API: The project likely relies on the Claude API for natural language processing tasks.
