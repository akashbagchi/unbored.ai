# akashbagchi/modern-portfolio - Architecture Overview

High-Level System Design:

The project follows a modern web application architecture with a separation of concerns between the frontend and backend. The frontend is built using the Nuxt.js framework, which is a Vue.js-based framework for building server-rendered and static web applications. The backend is a RESTful API built using Nuxt server handlers and a PostgreSQL database managed by the Drizzle ORM.

Tech Stack and Rationale:

Frontend:
- Nuxt.js (Vue.js framework): Provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and a modular architecture for building Vue.js applications.
- PrimeVue: A comprehensive UI component library for Vue.js, offering a wide range of pre-built components and utilities.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- GSAP: A popular JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations and transitions.

Backend:
- Neon PostgreSQL (serverless): A serverless PostgreSQL database solution, providing a scalable and managed database service.
- Drizzle ORM: A TypeScript-first ORM for building type-safe database queries and migrations.
- Nuxt server handlers: Nuxt's built-in server middleware for handling API routes and server-side logic.

The chosen tech stack prioritizes performance, developer experience, and maintainability. Nuxt.js and PrimeVue provide a solid foundation for building modern, server-rendered Vue.js applications with a rich set of UI components. Tailwind CSS offers utility classes for rapid UI development, while GSAP enables advanced animations. On the backend, Neon PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM simplify database management and ensure type safety.

Major Components and Responsibilities:

1. **Frontend**:
   - `components/layout`: Contains layout components like the navigation bar and notifications.
   - `components/ui`: Holds reusable UI components such as project cards, tech stack display, and hero sections.
   - `composables`: Provides reusable composition functions for shared logic (e.g., theme management, mobile detection).
   - `pages`: Defines the application's routes and page components.

2. **Backend**:
   - `server/api`: Contains API endpoints for handling CRUD operations on projects.
   - `server/db`: Manages the database connection, schema, and migration scripts.

Data Flow:

1. **Initial Page Load**: When a user visits the application, Nuxt.js server-renders the requested page and sends the HTML to the client. This ensures optimal initial load performance.

2. **API Requests**: The frontend components interact with the backend API to fetch and manipulate project data. These requests are made using Nuxt's `useFetch` or `useAsyncData` composables.

3. **Database Interaction**: The backend API handlers communicate with the PostgreSQL database through the Drizzle ORM. This includes querying, creating, updating, and deleting project data.

4. **State Management**: Vue's Composition API and custom composables are used for managing application state and shared logic, such as theme preferences and mobile detection.

External Dependencies:

- **Vercel**: The application is configured for deployment on Vercel, a cloud platform for hosting static and server-rendered applications.
- **Neon PostgreSQL**: A serverless PostgreSQL database service provided by Neon, used for storing and managing project data.

This overview covers the high-level system design, tech stack rationale, major components, data flow, and external dependencies of the project. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the application's architecture and technical decisions for a developer with 2 years of experience.
